## Evergreen Completion Log — 2026-01-14 00:04:11

- Repo: bananow.land
- Class: A (Next.js app)
- Branch: evergreening
- Runtime/Tooling: Node 24.x (`.nvmrc`), npm 11.7.0 (`packageManager`), Next.js 16.1.1

### Monthly cycle
- Install: `npm ci`.
- Outdated: `npm outdated` → only `@types/node` shows latest 25.x; intentionally pinned to 24.x per Evergreen policy.
- Security: `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` → 0 vulnerabilities.
- Lint: `npm run lint` → pass.
- Build: Initial Turbopack build failed fetching Google Fonts due to restricted network; reran with network access and build succeeded.
- Live check: `https://land.endhonesa.com/` returns HTTP 429 Vercel challenge (reachable but blocked).

### Quarterly cycle
- No additional major upgrades performed; stack already on current majors (Next 16, React 19, Tailwind 4). `@types/node` intentionally held at 24.x.

### Parity
- No source changes; behaviour unchanged.
